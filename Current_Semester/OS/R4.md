# Multithreading

## Types of Threads

- **User-Level Threads**  
  Virtual threads managed in user space, typically mapped to a single hardware thread.  
  **Con:** Blocking I/O operations can delay all threads.

- **Kernel-Level Threads**  
  Managed by the OS and run on actual CPU cores (multi-core support).  
  **Con:** Higher overhead due to context switching.

## `std::thread` Class

- A thread is an instance of the `std::thread` template class.
- It enables concurrent execution of functions.
- The class itself does not specify if it's user or kernel-level.
- On most compilers/platforms, threads are implemented as **kernel-level** threads.
- A thread receives a function to run.

### Example:

```cpp
std::thread t1(thread_func, 1, -2);
```

When using threads, the main thread continues its execution and may terminate before other threads finish.  
**Important:** You must make the main thread wait for others.

---

## Waiting for Threads

To wait for a thread to finish, use `.join()`:

```cpp
t1.join();
t2.join();
```

This blocks the main thread until `t1` and `t2` have finished executing.

---

## Tips

1. **Use `std::jthread` (C++20+)**  
   Automatically joins the thread when it goes out of scope.  
   Replace `std::thread` with `std::jthread` where possible.

2. **Thread utilities from `<thread>`:**
   - `std::this_thread::yield()` — Hints to the scheduler to switch to another thread.
   - `std::this_thread::sleep_for()` — Sleeps for a given time (`std::chrono` duration).

3. **Using Lambdas with Threads:**

```cpp
std::thread t([](const int &wait) {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(wait));
}, 5);

t.join();
```

---

## Race Conditions

Multiple threads accessing the same memory can lead to **race conditions**.

Example:

```cpp
int x = 0;
void increment() { x++; }

// If two threads run increment() simultaneously, x might still be 1 instead of 2.
```

---

## Solution: Atomic Variables

Use `std::atomic` to safely handle shared variables:

```cpp
std::atomic<int> x = 0;

void thread_function() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000000; i++) {
        x++;
    }
}
```

- Atomic variables prevent race conditions by ensuring operations like `++` or `+=` are atomic.
- Avoid using non-atomic compound expressions like `x = x + 5`; prefer `x += 5`.

---

## Summary

- Threads allow concurrent execution.
- Always manage thread lifetimes with `join()` or `std::jthread`.
- Race conditions occur without synchronization.
- Use `std::atomic` for safe shared memory access.


> Sidenote: atomic doesn't work on complex structures like std::vector

### Solution Mutex
A mutex is primitive synchronisation mechanism
Made for protecting critical section 
*YOU KNOW THIS FROM GO!*
Two options:
- Lock = Only i can access
- Unlock =  Available for others
#### std::mutex
- Abstract class for mutex
- Mutex object must be shared among threads.
### Snyc mutex - std::unique_lock
A wrapper for mutex.
Allows easier access instead of lock and unlock we send ref of mutex
std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock
### Sync mutex - Semaphores
Generalized Version of mutex
Allows at most N threads to a critical section
Unlike mutex it's value can be modified in runtime.
1) std::counting_semaphore
- Constructor takes the initial value.
- release releases semaphore (up/post)
- acquire acquire semaphore (down/wait)
2) std::binary_semaphore
- same as mutex
### Another Solution : Conditional Variable uses Mutex
Also called *Monitor*
- Threads wait before the section
- Can do broadcast 
Every thread that wants to wait needs to receive mutex after that calls wait

Implement Barrier that has
- int arrived  = how many threads we have
- num_threads 
- condition_variable
- mutex
- has constructor and wait.
void Barrier::wait(){
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(this->mtx);
    int currently_arrived = ++this->arrived;
    if(currently_arrived == this->num_threads)
    // if all threads arrive broadcast
    {
        this->arrived=0;
        this->cv.notify_all()
    }
    else{
    while(this->arrived!=0)
    this->cv.wait(lock);
    }
}
// notify-all allows for threads to wake
## Thread Local Cache (TLS)
Allows to create a copy of a shared resource.
### Debugg tips
- Don't print as it's not necessarily momenterial
- Debug mode allows for thread debugging.

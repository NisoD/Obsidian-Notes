## Success of Context switch
- Mutual Exclusion
- Starvation Free - no thread will be waiting forever
- Progress - Everybody can progress
### Dining Philosophers Problem
> Deadlock is indefinite waiting for realease
Philosophers have a shared resource rice bowl
Each philosopher needs two chopsticks to eat left and right
### Solution 1
Use a waiter that can redistribute the chopsticks
### Another possibilites
- Randomized Lehmann Rabin
- Execute different code for odd/even
#### Lhemann Rabinn Algorithm
1) coin flip to choose left or right chopstick
2) wait for chopstick to be freed
3) if the another chopstick is free take it and break
4) if not free release the second chopstick
## Bounded buffer Problem
We have to types of threads
- Producers and consumers 
- We want to make sure producer doesn't overflow the buffer
- We want to make sure consumer doesn't consume when buffer is empty
> As the buffer is shared resource we want to protect it
### Solution - counting semaphores
1) Usual mutex to protect the buffer
2) Semaphore fillCount init to 0 -> counts items avialble for reading
3) Semaphore emptyCount init to N -> indicates how many available to write
## Readers Writers Problem
We have readers of files and writers that change them
### Writer Priority Solution
- Mutex read stops readers when writer want to write
- Int writeCount init to 0 = Counts waiting writers
- writeCount_mutex - Controls updating writeCount
- Mutex queue

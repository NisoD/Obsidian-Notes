## 📌 Side Notes on the Course
- The course is both **practical** and **theoretical**.
- Weekly Quiz **N-2** → Go to **Magen**.
- Must achieve a total of **60** across **4 out of 5 exercises**.
- The **exam** is more **theoretical** than practical.

## 📝 Side Notes on Exercises
- **Language:** C++
- ❌ No external libraries allowed.
- 🐧 **Use Linux**.
- 🚀 Exercises are **challenging** and time-consuming.
- ⏳ **Start early!**
- 🏆 **40%** of the final course grade.
- ✅ **Exercise 1** is easier—complete it early.

⚠ **Zero Tolerance for Cheating!**

## 🎯 Course Motivation
> 🔘 What happens when we press a button or move the mouse?

> 📂 What happens when we read/write to a file?

> ⏳ Reading a file is slow—how does a computer stay responsive?

> 🎵 How can you play music, scan for viruses, and read a document on a single processor?

> ⚠ What does a **segmentation fault** mean?

> What are virtual machines and how does it communicate with each other?

### Recap 
#### What is an OS?
- A computer software that manages the resources of the computer.
** IT IS SOFTWARE **
- CPU Time Scheduling
- Memory
- Files
- I/O
The Operation System provides abstraction of other applications and

- The OS works without knowing the 'input' beforehand
- *Performance Matters!*
#### CPU - Central Processing Unit
- Contains Registers (The smallest memory segments we have)
- Understand only registers.
There are tens of registers,Important Registers are:
- PC - Program Counter , The next command.
- SP - Stack Pointer , Pointer to the head of stack.
(The stack contains the function frames and local variables)
- IR - Instruction Register, the current command executed.
> Example of a set of instructions :
> - **Data Hanlding** - set a register, store, load.
> - **Arithmetic Operations** - Bitwise ops, compare,math
> - **Control flow**- branch, condtional branchs.

#### Memory Hierarchy 
- Main Memory located on chips insde the computer outside of CPU
- External Memory disk
##### Disk Controller
- can I/O from the main memory, (RAM<-->Memory)
- Today DMA (without OS intervention)
##### Cache 
Comes with the CPU, higher cost time for I/O than RAM, 
The cache doesn't replace the main memory but rather enables a pool for oftenly used things.
Registers -> L1 Cache -> ... -> L4 Cache -> Main Memory -> SSD -> HDD
We have no control of this cache it is hardware level.

#### Virtualization
Creating a virtual version of someting 
- Storage Devices
- VM

# Input Valgrind Part.



#### Debugging System Calls
- Basic Commands 
- Open(path,flags), Opens a file, returns file descritor
- read
- Write
this are system calls that abstract I/O for us.
##### Debugging
Linux Strace {file} -  Provides monitoring of system calls.
Format *System Call,Arguemnts,Return Value*

###### Ex1
- You will get compiled code and need to understand what does the program does.
- You will be measuring avg latency of single op from large arr
- The arr will spread over all caches and main memory.

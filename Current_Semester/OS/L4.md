# Problem
When two threads access a shared resource.
What happens if they have a race condition and the OS does a context switch.
> i.e Read and context switch and then two threads that inc the shared resource keep it 1 instead of 2.
### Critical Section
A piece of code that accesses the shared resources.

#### Dijkstra approach
Critical section will have entry code and exit code.
- We can block all ctx switches 


### Deadlock
A **deadlock** occurs when two or more threads are **waiting indefinitely** for each other to release resources, leading to a standstill where no progress is possible.

It typically happens when:
- Multiple threads hold **some resources** and **wait for others** held by other threads.
- Each is blocked, creating a circular wait condition.

---

### Race Condition Scenario
When **two threads access a shared resource**, and there's **no synchronization**, a **race condition** can occur.

**Example**:
- Shared variable `x = 0`
- Thread A and Thread B both do `x++`

If the OS does a **context switch** after Thread A **reads `x`**, and then Thread B reads and increments `x`, then:
- Both read `x = 0`
- Both increment and write back `1`
- Final value is `1`, but it should be `2`

This happens because both threads enter the **critical section** simultaneously without coordination.

---

### Critical Section
A **critical section** is a piece of code that accesses **shared resources** (like memory, files, or devices) that must not be concurrently accessed by more than one thread.

---

### Dijkstraâ€™s Approach
To protect the critical section:
- **Entry code**: Ensures mutual exclusion (e.g., acquire lock).
- **Exit code**: Releases the lock or condition.

One naive solution:
- **Block all context switches** during the critical section (not ideal in practice, but a theoretical base).

--- 

### Peterson's Algorithm
**Peterson's Algorithm** is a classical software-based solution for achieving **mutual exclusion** between two threads or processes.

It ensures:
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one thread enters the critical section.
- **Progress**: If no thread is in the critical section, one will eventually get in.
- **Bounded Waiting**: No thread is indefinitely blocked.

It uses two variables:
- `flag[2]`: Indicates if a thread **wants to enter** the critical section.
- `turn`: Indicates whose turn it is to enter the critical section.

---

#### Peterson's Algorithm Pseudocode (for two threads: 0 and 1)

```c
// Shared variables
bool flag[2] = {false, false};
int turn;

// Thread 0
flag[0] = true;
turn = 1;
while (flag[1] && turn == 1) {
    // busy wait
}
// critical section
...
flag[0] = false; // exit section

// Thread 1
flag[1] = true;
turn = 0;
while (flag[0] && turn == 0) {
    // busy wait
}
// critical section
...
flag[1] = false; // exit section
```

---
> We notice that busy waiting isn't usefull to use resources while we are waiting for Context Switch.
> Another point is that this algorithm can be altered during optimization and must be handled via 'voliatile'


### We want an atomic solution 
A continuous operation needs to be atomic.
### Alogirhtm Lamport 
- Doesn't require a busy waiting useless use of resources

Each thread is waiting in line has a nubmer and index and we use  a flag of choosing for making sure each thread has a unique number.
#### Modern CPU
  manufacter gave us a possobility  
Test&Set(&Lock)
  to set a given pointer to 1 and return it as a atomic prossess Test&Set(&Lock) manufacter gave us a possobility  to set a given pointer to 1 and return it as a atomic prossess
Fetch&Add(&p,inc)
Gets a p and increases it in inc size.
Compare&Swap(&p,old,new)
return *p==new (boolean )
### Algoirthm Berns uses TestnSet
There is a global lock, waiting list and key list.
Each time a thread access cricial section it :
- Lock <- True
- Waiting[i] <- True
- Key[i] <- 1
To avoid starvation when a thread finishes the Lock stays true
And the next in line starts
If no one is waiting then lock is set to 0
 
#### Round Robin 
Go by indecies 
All Solutions use busy waiting
### Manufacturers Solution For Busy Waiting
Requires a semaphore
> Like a garage with parking spaces 
- Down S.value --
- Up S.value ++
- Init S.value=v
We init a semaphore to a value
Mutex Binary Semaphore
